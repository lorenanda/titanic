# Predicting Titanic passenger survival
This project was completed in week 2 of the Data Science Bootcamp at Spiced Academy.

The goal is to predict what passengers would survive the Titanic sink, based on information like gender, cabin, family, ticket price.

## Exploratory data analysis
- 63% of first-class passengers (97% of women) survived, compared to 24% (50% of women) of third-class passengers.
- Passengers who survived were younger (avg. 28 years old) than those who didn't (avg. 30 years old).
- Most passengers were men, followed by married women, girls, and boys.
- The survival rate is correlated with passenger class, age, and gender.

## Classification models
- Logistic Regression: 82% accuracy (on kaggle competition: 74.641%)
- Decision Tree: 78% accuracy
- Random Forest Classifier: 80% accuracy
- Ensemble Model: 93% accuracy
